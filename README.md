# Pharmaceutical Drug Spending by Countries
Data Science Institute - Cohort 4 - Team 22 Project

As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Torontoâ€™s Data Sciences Institute, our capstone project was both a challenge and an opportunity to grow. We chose the "Pharmaceutical Drug Spending by Countries" dataset and we approached this project as both a learning exercise and an opportunity to apply our analytical and technical skills. From summarizing data and handling missing values to creating visualizations and narrowing a broad business case into actionable insights, this project demonstrates our accomplishments throughout the certification program and highlights our potential to contribute to the data science field.

## Business Case

Our team has selected the Pharmaceutical Drug Spending by Countries dataset. Our goal is to identify the Top 10 and Bottom 10 spending countries (ranked by the average of Health Spending per Capita) to gain insights on these two country groupings. To start, we explored the general characteristics of the raw data and came up with a strategy to handle missing values. We implemented an aggregation to the year range 2005 and 2014 to clean the data from missing values and outliers. Next, we grouped the Top 10 and Bottom 10 countries and explored them using Linear Regression, Clustering, Forecasting and Static and Dynamic Data Visualization using python. Optionally, we also explored data visualization using Tableau Public.

### Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries

* NumPy : For fast matrix operations.
* pandas : For analysing and getting insights from datasets.
* matplotlib : For creating graphs and plots.
* seaborn : For enhancing the style of matplotlib plots.
* sklearn : For linear regression analysis.
* ydata_profiling : For EDA
* pandas_visual_analysis : Visual Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The library ydata_profiling was used to quickly generate an overview of the dataset, revealing distributions, correlations, and potential issues like missing values. Pandas_visual_analysis was used to create interactive visualizations that highlight relationships and trends in the data. Both tools automate the generation of dynamic detailed reports and visualizations, saving time compared to manual exploration and coding.

To explore the dynamic features download the [1_EDA.ipynb](1_EDA.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Understanding the Raw Data

The supporting python code can be viewed in the [2_summarizations.ipynb](2_summarizations.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values

Through preprocessing we are able to identify missing values and outliers. To assist in visualizing the missing values in our dataset we created a heatmap, where blue indicated available data and yellow indicated missing data.

![Heatmap of Missing Data](images/missing_values.png)

### Our Considerations: 

* Impact on Analysis:
    * More years generally provide a better trend analysis but come with the trade-off of more missing data.
    * Fewer years provide more complete data but may not capture long-term trends and changes effectively.

* Number of Countries:
    * Dropping fewer countries is preferable to maintain a larger sample size for more robust comparative analysis.
    * However, if the number of dropped countries does not significantly impact the representation, it may be acceptable to drop them for a more complete dataset.

* Business Case:
    * The focus on this project requires reliable data to identify high and low spenders accurately.
    * Data completeness is critical to avoid biased conclusions and ensure accurate identification of best practices.

Based on this heatmap visualization and our aggregation considerations, our group decided to aggregate the dataset to the year range 2005 to 2014 and drop 4 countries (New Zealand, Russia, Turkey, and United Kingdom). 

| Start Date | End Date | # of Years | # Dropped Countries | List of Dropped Countries |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 2005 | 2014 | 10 | 4 | New Zealand, Russia, Turkey, United Kingdom |

NOTE: For some but not all analyses Israel was dropped and/or the data for 2015 was used.

### Correlation between Features

To explore the relationships between different variables we created a heatmap to visualize the correlation between each feature where a correlation closer to 1.00 means more correlated.

![Heatmap of correlations between features](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

The following table shows the correlations between features.

| feature 1 | feature 2 | correlation |
|:---------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| USD_CAP   | TIME      | 0.84        |
| PC_HEALTHXP |  PC_GDP | 0.72 |
| PC_GDP | USD_CAP | 0.67 |
| PC_GDP | TIME | 0.61 |

Since the correlation between the Health Spending per Capita vs Time produced a high correlation compared to the other variables, our team focused our efforts on this correlation when exploring the Top 10 and Bottom 10 health expenditure per country. Additionally, working with the Health Expenditure per Capita standardized our data exploration to already incorporate the other factors such as population.

The supporting python code can be viewed in the [3_data_cleaning.ipynb](3_data_cleaning.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Identifying Top 10 and Bottom 10 Spenders
The ranking is based off the average health spend per capita for the year range 2005 to 2014. Due to the time restrainst of this team project, we opted to focus on the Top 10 and Bottom 10 countries and ommitted exploring the countries that fell in the mid-level category. By doing so our analysis is not completely comprehensive but it allowed us to explore the polar ends of the dataset more thoroughly.

# Data Analysis on Python
Now that we have grouped the Top 10 and Bottom 10 countries we are able to explore them using Linear Regression, Clustering, Forecasting as well as Static and Dynamic Data Visualization using python. Optionally, we also explored data visualization using Tableau Public. 

## Multiple Linear Regression

We chose to regress TOTAL_SPEND on variables USD_CAP, PC_HEALTHXP, and PC_GDP , to explore how these factors influence total spending. To understand the relationship between total spending and these independent variables, which we hypothesize might have an impact on the total amount spent by each country. Due to missing values only 2004-2015 was used and RUS,ISR,TUR,NZL and GBR were dropped. 
However, it's important we are using a timeseries data set and Linear Regression is not the best model for a timeseries analysis. This model is likely to suffer from autocorrelation, stationarity, and overfitting. Models such as ARMA or ARIMA would have been better suited, but we did not cover those in the course. If we had more time we could have explored other models. 

Since our dataset contains 2016 data for a few countries, we choose to forecast 2016 first and then compare the error to see the difference between the forecast and the actual. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96228635-f7ab-4a4d-9d8f-49c240b9538f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d73cd0-503a-43a2-94d0-3d71fe52cc8e)

The errors are low enough so we can proceed to forecast 2016-2018.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b462569-364d-40da-896a-c5c1259691ec)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20d8060-f188-4a07-9259-eb2a59e8e23c)

The R-square being 1 suggests overfitting. The Durbin-Watson statistic also suggests autocorrelation. We predicted both of these problems would happen earlier due to using Linear Regression.However, the p-value of the F-statistic is really small which means the model is still significant. The coefficients for PC_HEALTHXP and USD_CAP are also significant, which means these have a strong relatoinship with our target variable.

To keep things simple, we only plot the forecast for top 10 countries using a 95% confidence interval.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d1d5cef-d55c-4d84-a088-f0c60fa27356)

All of the forecasted points fall within the 95% confidence interval, indicating that they are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Although our model suffers from some limitations, the outcome is still significant.

NOTE: Isreal was dropped because it was missing values for 2014, 2015 and 2016.

The supporting python code can be viewed in the [5_linear_regression.ipynb](5_linear_regression.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Linear Regression (Dynamic Plots)

We also developed an interactive method to explore the linear regression for each country which can be filtered by Location and Features. Below is a screenshot:

![screenshot of dynamic plot for lineear regression](images/Regression_F.png)

To explore the dynamic features download the [7_dynamic_plots.ipynb](7_dynamic_plots.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Clustering

The clustering analysis grouped the 20 selected countries (top 10 and bottom 10 spenders) into three distinct clusters:

| Cluster # | Category | Countries |
|:---------:|:--------:|:----------|
| 0 | Top | LUX, CAN, CHE, GRC, JPN, IRL, DEU, FRA, BEL |
| 1 | Bottom | CZE, LTU, DNK, POL, NLD, MEX, EST, LVA, NOR, ISR
| 2 | Outlier | USA |

* Cluster 0: Represents the top 10 spending countries (excluding the USA), confirming their high average pharmaceutical expenditure per capita.
* Cluster 1: Corresponds to the bottom 10 spending countries, highlighting their lower average pharmaceutical expenditure per capita.
* Cluster 2: Contains only the United States, an outlier due to its significantly higher spending per capita and total expenditure compared to other countries.

### Key Observations
* Outlier Identification: The USA, being in its own cluster, underscores its unique position as an extreme high-spender. This finding aligns with its distinct spending patterns observed during earlier analyses.
* Spending Patterns:
    * Cluster 0 countries (top spenders) exhibit high per-capita pharmaceutical expenditure but lower percentages of total healthcare spending allocated to pharmaceuticals.
    * Conversely, Cluster 1 countries (bottom spenders) show lower per-capita expenditures but allocate a higher proportion of their healthcare budgets to pharmaceuticals.

### Visual Insights

Cluster Graph: The clustering plot visually demonstrates the separation between the three clusters, with the USA distinctly positioned as an outlier.

![Clustering plot for the top 10 and bottom 10 countries](images/kmeans_clustering.png)

Average Features by Cluster: A bar plot comparing cluster-level averages reveals that countries in Cluster 0 and Cluster 2 spend substantially more per capita, while Cluster 1 countries allocate a larger share of their healthcare budgets to pharmaceuticals.

![Plot of the average features by clusters](images/avg_clustering.png)

### Implications

After clustering these 20 countries, they were categorized into 3 clusters. Cluster 0 confirms the top 10 spending countries ranked by average spend per capita. Cluster 1 confirms the bottom 10 spending countries ranked by average spend per capita. Cluster 3 contains only one country (USA), which according to average spend per capita is considered a top spending country. As shown on the cluster graph, USA is an outlier in terms of spending per capita and total spending therefore it's in a category of its own.

Many of the high-spending countries have strong economies with high GDP per capita, which allows them to spend more on drugs. Even if their pharmaceutical spending is low as a percentage of healthcare expenditure (PC_HEALTHXP), their high GDP amplifies their total spending, reflecting the wealth of these countries. Despite having the ability to spend more, they allocate a larger proportion of their healthcare resources to other areas, such as preventative care, outpatient services, and advanced technologies. Additionally, many of these countries regulate drug prices by negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies or promoting the use of generics, further reducing the share of healthcare expenditure dedicated to pharmaceuticals. These factors illustrate how these countries maintain efficient healthcare systems while keeping pharmaceutical costs relatively low as a proportion of health expenditure.

For the low-spending countries, thereâ€™s a mix of those with low GDPs and those with higher GDP per capita. Countries with lower GDPs have less to spend and may underfund their healthcare systems, resulting in a reliance on pharmaceutical drugs to meet healthcare needs. This reliance leads to higher pharmaceutical spending as a percentage of healthcare expenditure (PC_HEALTHXP), even though their overall healthcare spending as a share of GDP (PC_GDP) remains low. On the other hand, countries with higher GDPs, such as the Nordic countries, have robust healthcare systems that emphasize preventative care and public health programs, reducing their reliance on drugs. Nevertheless, their wealth enables them to spend more on pharmaceuticals as a share of healthcare expenditure, reflecting their capacity to invest in diverse healthcare priorities.

Finally for the USA, their outlier status is influenced by the privatization of their healthcare system.

Future analyses could look at each country and investigate the economic and social factors that influence their spending patterns on pharmaceutical drugs. We could also explore mid-level spenders and examine additional variables like population health outcomes to uncover further insights.

The supporting python code can be viewed in the [6_clustering.ipynb](6_clustering.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Dynamic Plots

Here are a few reasons why dynamic plotting is beneficial:

- Interactivity Enhances Insights: Dynamic plots allow users to zoom, pan, and hover over data points, making it easier to explore and uncover trends, patterns, or outliers that static plots might obscure.

- Customizable Views: Users can filter data, adjust parameters, or select specific subsets, enabling a more tailored analysis without regenerating the entire plot.

- Better Storytelling: Dynamic visualizations can adapt to different narratives or audiences, making them ideal for interactive dashboards or presentations where stakeholders can explore the data themselves.

- Real-Time Data Exploration: Dynamic plots are perfect for situations where datasets are updated in real-time or where rapid iterations of visualizations are needed to analyze evolving trends.

- Improved User Engagement: By involving the viewer in the analysis process, dynamic plots encourage engagement and deeper understanding compared to passive consumption of static visuals.

- Scalable for Large Datasets: With tools like Plotly and Dash, dynamic visualizations can handle large datasets efficiently, providing responsive and smooth interaction capabilities.

Dynamic plots turn static visuals into tools for exploration, making data analysis more interactive, flexible, and engaging.

## Forecasting

The method of forecasting in the provided code uses Facebook Prophet, a powerful open-source forecasting tool designed for time series data. It is particularly effective when your data exhibits patterns like seasonality, trends, or irregular intervals.

#### Why Prophet for This Task?

* Automatic Seasonality Detection: Prophet automatically identifies yearly or weekly cycles in the data, which is useful when you have data like spending trends.
* Handles Missing Data: Prophet can deal with missing or irregular data, which is common in real-world datasets.
* Confidence Intervals: It provides predictions with uncertainty bounds (e.g., upper and lower confidence intervals), helping to assess the reliability of forecasts.
* Ease of Use: Minimal configuration is required, making it accessible for quick forecasting.

NOTE: This is a dynamic plot and requires being opened. To explore the dynamic features download the [7_dynamic_plots.ipynb](7_dynamic_plots.ipynb) file in our repo.

## Data Visualization on Tableau

* Pharmaceutical Spending Dashboard ([Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anna.karlova/viz/Pharmaspendingbycountries1970-2015/Dashboard1))
* Top 10 Countries Dashboard ([Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrienne.lloren/viz/PharmaceuticalDrugSpendingbyCountries_17333346970600/TOP10))
* Bottom 10 Countries Dashboard ([Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrienne.lloren/viz/PharmaceuticalDrugSpendingbyCountries_17333346970600/BOTTOM10))


### Summary of Pharmaceutical Spending Analysis Using Tableau

The interactive Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of pharmaceutical spending trends across countries from 2005 to 2014, highlighting total expenditure, spending per capita, spending as a percentage of GDP, and health expenditure.
Designed with practicality in mind, the Tableau dashboard is user-friendly and does not require programming expertise. It uses a map, bar charts, line graphs, and a bubble diagram to enable visual exploration. Users can filter data by country, year, and key parameters to interactively analyze historical and comparative trends in pharmaceutical spending. 
The insights obtained using Tableau, including top 10 and bottom 10 spenders, are almost identical to the results derived from Python analysis, underscoring the reliability of both tools in interpreting the data. 

Key findings reveal that the USA leads in total spending, per capita expenditure, and health budget allocation, driven by high drug prices and broad pharmaceutical access. Meanwhile, some countries face significant economic burdens due to high spending relative to GDP, whereas wealthier nations like Luxembourg demonstrate more efficient resource allocation. Additionally, developed nations exhibit consistent growth in pharmaceutical spending, while smaller economies often stagnate, reflecting disparities in economic and healthcare systems. 

Tableauâ€™s interactive and user-friendly platform makes it ideal for visualizing data and generating accessible insights for a broad audience. On the other hand, Python offers advanced analytical capabilities, such as deep statistical analysis, advanced data transformation, and predictive modeling. 



## Conclusion
The analysis revealed significant disparities between the top 10 and bottom 10 countries in pharmaceutical spending per capita. Leveraging insights from correlations and trends, the study highlighted the importance of accurate and complete data for effective decision-making. While the project explored key patterns and developed robust visual and statistical models, time constraints limited the scope to a focused subset of the dataset. Future efforts could include deeper analysis into mid-tier countries, adoption of advanced forecasting models, and exploration of causative factors beyond expenditures, such as population health outcomes. This project underscores the potential of data science in driving informed policy decisions and optimizing healthcare expenditures worldwide.

* https://github.com/datasets/pharmaceutical-drug-spending

## Team Work Agreement

* We all agreed that we will independently work on all parts of the project and then during the 2nd team project week, we will compare, contrast and compile our findings into our Main branch.
* We will meet up on at 1pm during our next few Friday work periods and allocate 30 mins to an hour discussing our team project.
* In the meantime, we will each create our own branches to the dsi_team_22 repo where we will commit and push the research, code and analysis we independently work on.
* The focus for the upcoming weeks will be on data cleaning (How to decide what to do with missing data) as well as categorizing the dataset by the Top 10 and Bottom 10 spenders based on the countries' Average Health Expenditure per Capita. Explore these categories and document your findings and analysis.
* As we progress with the next few modules, we will revisit our tasks and deliverables for our team project.

## Initial Exploratory Data Analysis

To start we explored line plot visualizations of the features in the dataset. Below are the data visualizations produced during this EDA.
